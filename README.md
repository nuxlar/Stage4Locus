# Stage 4 Locus

Edits the Void Locus stage to be a regular stage 4. Enemies/Interactables/Credits have been changed to suit a normal stage 4. There is a red chest and 1 (for now) newt statue on the map. Deactivates void pillars (for now) so you won't be able to use this to go to Voidling.

- **Credits:** 400
- **Monsters:** Imps, Lemurians, Vultures
- **Minibosses:** Jailers, Parents, Greater Wisps
- **Bosses:** Devastators, Grovetenders, Imp Overlords

## Future Plans
- Use Void Pillars for the red
- Add random newt altars
